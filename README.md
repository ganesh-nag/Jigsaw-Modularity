# Jigsaw-Modularity
Explains Jigsaw Modular design

@author Ganesh Nagalingam

The code is developed using Java SE 11. 
Three modules have been designed and developed to explain Jigsaw modularity. 
To learn and understand, the code can be imported into your local machine and can be tested.
It consists of module-info.java file and one or more packages. Modules offer stronger encapsulation than jars.

What is Jigsaw ?
Project Jigsaw- Its a flagship feature of Java 9.
It introduces modularity to monolithic Java SE ecosystem. The primary goal of the Jigsaw project was to make the 
Java SE Platform and the JDK more easily scalable down. 
Modularization of the JDK enables the source code to be completely restructured in order to make it easier to maintain. 
Module is a self-describing collection of code, data and resources. 

Happy learning!!!
